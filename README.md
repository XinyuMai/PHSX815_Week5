# PHSX815_Week5
I am sampling from the Sigmoid function 1/(1 + e^x)

## This repository contains several types of programs:
* `SigmoidSampling.py` 
* `Random.py`
* `CalculatePi.py` and `GaussRandom.py` are example code provided by Prof.Rogan in class

## General info
This repository will include HW5 and HW6 practice - using the rejection sampling method to sampling from a distributino and visualize the target distribution, proposal distribution and random samples.

## Code Usage
* Can be run from the command line using the `-h` flag to display usage options. 
* e.g `python SigmoidSampling.py -Nsample [number] -range [Xmax]`
* `Nsample` is specified for number of samples from the target distribution, `range` is specified when to change the range of x values from the sampling.
